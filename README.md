An event planner geared towards not only personal event organization but also group events. Our event planner allows friends, families, teams, and so on to create group events that can easily be modified, changed, and synced across all attendees. Additionally, our event planner allows groups to create polls for various group events to enable easy voting and automatic event creation.
